          Automating inspection is the bottleneck for inline CT settings.
          Machine learning is inevitable but challenging: data is scarce and
          sensitive, custom models are required for each setting, and production
          systems have strict latency and throughput constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roughly speaking, there are three attack angles:
          <ol>
            <li>Make training data acquisition easier.</li>
            <li>
              Develop models that require less (annotated) data for training.
            </li>
            <li>Make models more computationally efficient.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of DeepSpect is to explore these angles to help lowering the barrier to entry for ML for industrial CT.
